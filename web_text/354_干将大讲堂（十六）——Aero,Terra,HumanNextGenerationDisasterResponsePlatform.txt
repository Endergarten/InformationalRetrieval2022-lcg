干将大讲堂（十六）——Aero, Terra, Human: Next Generation Disaster Response Platform

Currently, the mainstream research of disaster management is how to accurately and promptly forecast and notify such as earthquake early warning, but since complete disaster prevention is impossible, we still have to focus on the rapid response after disasters. In addition, to gain insight into the real-time situation of the affected area, we need the two-way communication between affected area and outside world. However, once the network infrastructure suffers from disasters, connections can be interrupted and support cannot reach affected area. Moreover, it is difficult to reconstruct the communication line from scratch. In order to achieve a set of post-disaster two-way communication solutions not relying on traditional network infrastructure, we design a next generation disaster response platform. There are mainly three problems to solve in this platform. First, the connections among users near to each other. Second, the connections between users and access points (APs). Third, the connections between APs and access network to outside world. To figure out first problem, we are going to make use of Device-to-Device (D2D) emergency communication in gathering users within the range of 100+m. Then for the second one, we take advantage of the high mobility of UAVs in fast building the emergency network with the range of 1000+m. For the third one, to realize the connection to outside world, we apply lower power wide area network (LPWAN) to expand the range to 10000+m. 董冕雄简介     Mianxiong Dong received B.S., M.S. and Ph.D. in Computer Science and Engineering from The University of Aizu, Japan.
